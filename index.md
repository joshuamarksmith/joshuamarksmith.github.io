I'm a Solutions Architect at AWS, where I help customers run and build platforms on the world's largest public cloud. I focus on Serverless technologies, helping enterprise startups operate efficiently.

Prior to AWS, I spent 9 years across various federal contracts, consulting engagements, and more, working in infrastructure engineering and cloud security architecture.

I was also a co-founder of Coinmunity, a former cryptocurrency data aggregation platform offering community growth and market analytics, as well as user-supported micro-funding for quality content.

Started in Architecture, switched to Computer Science years later. Currently working on my Master of CS at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Love to travel and track down new food and craft beers. Other hobbies include hiking, snowboarding, cycling, talking big ideas, and building neat things.
